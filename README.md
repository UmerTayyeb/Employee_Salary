# Employee_Salary
This Go project demonstrates how to read data from text files, perform data manipulation, and store the required information in another text file. 
The project showcases a simple example of working with file input and output operations in Go.

Features
Read employee data from text file.
Process and manipulate the data as needed.
Store the modified data in an output text file.
Display formatted output with aligned columns.

How it Works
Reading Data: The program opens text file, containing employee information, including names and salaries.
Data Manipulation: It reads the data line by line, splitting each line into relevant components using delimiters. The employee data is stored in a custom Employee struct.
Formatting and Manipulation: The program can perform various data manipulations, such as comparing employee salaries and printing pairs of employees with equal salaries.
Writing Data: The manipulated data is formatted and written to an output text file in a tabular format, showing aligned columns for a neat presentation.

This project serves as an educational example of file input/output operations and basic data manipulation in Go. 
It demonstrates how to structure code for reading, processing, and writing data, making it a great starting point for learning Go programming concepts.

Feel free to explore, modify, and expand upon this project to further enhance your Go programming skills.
